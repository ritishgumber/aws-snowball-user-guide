# Shipping Considerations for AWS Snowball<a name="shipping"></a>

Following, you can find information about how shipping is handled for AWS Snowball, and a list that shows each AWS Region that is supported\. The shipping rate you choose for a job applies to both sending and receiving the Snowball or Snowballs used for that job\. For information on shipping charges, see [AWS Snowball Pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/snowball/pricing)\.

**Note**  
When you create a job, you specify a shipping address and shipping speed\. This shipping speed doesn’t indicate how soon you can expect to receive the Snowball from the day you created the job\. It only shows the time that the appliance is in transit between AWS and your shipping address\. That time doesn’t include any time for processing\. Processing time depends on factors including job type \(exports take longer than imports, typically\) and job size \(80\-TB models take longer than 50\-TB models, typically\)\. Also, carriers generally only pick up outgoing Snowballs once a day\. Thus, processing before shipping can take a day or more\.

## Preparing a Snowball for Shipping<a name="appliance-shipping"></a>

The following explains how to prepare a Snowball appliance and ship it back to AWS\.

**To prepare a Snowball for shipping**

1. Make sure that you've finished transferring all the data for this job to or from the Snowball\.

1. Power off the Snowball by pressing the power button above the digital display\.
**Note**  
If you've powered off and unplugged the Snowball, and your shipping label doesn't appear after about a minute, contact [AWS Support](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/)\.

1. Disconnect and stow the cables the Snowball was sent with\. The back panel of the Snowball has a cable caddie that holds the cables safely during the return trip\.

1. Close the two panels on the back and front of the Snowball, pressing in until you hear and feel them click\.

You don't need to pack the Snowball in a container, because it is its own physically rugged shipping container\. The E Ink display on the front of the Snowball changes to your return shipping label when the Snowball is turned off\.
